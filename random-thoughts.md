## thoughts from doƒüubeyazƒ±t

250 years old [ƒ∞shakpa≈üa Palace](https://www.instagram.com/p/BQ6HF0CgfPb/)... One of the most beautiful places I've been in my life. It's in Iranian border, and unfortunately the armed conflict in the area keeps visitors away from here.

I feel happy and sad at same time. Happy because even a little corner of my country has such a fantastic architecture I've never seen before. Happy because the hospitality here is uncomparable, how they welcome foreigners or local tourists with that great positive vibe, inviting visitors to have tea with them... Sad because the economy in the region is affected by escelated war, a meaningless violence that noone here deserves. .

No matter what, I love here. One day we'll have peace and we'll solve our issues, and hopefully that time, our children or grandchildren will never have to leave their families to go abroad for work like this generation do. This land deserves peace, and is enough for all of us.

## surviving fairly

one day I gave two kids some small gifts because I liked them. their auntie saw us and invited to have tea. we met the whole family, had tea. I'm talking about may be 50 cups of tea. we don't even speak the same language but we tell eachother stories, we are connected.

We were in Alaska 1.5 year ago, knocked a random door in a native village, ended up meeting all the family, had lunch together, listened their stories, learnt a lot of stuff about how Mentasta indians dealt colonialist occupation; probably the biggest robbery in the world history. .

I got sick in Indonesia last summer, my body was fucked up. We kept walking, for hours. Then my body shut down, I slept for hours under a tree not being able to open my eyes. We found a village, Nova asked someone to help us. They invited me to their home and cooked food. I could walk more, we made it to Wae Rebo by walking, and a woman tourist from New Zeeland with medicine and basic tools helped me to recover that night.

One of the moments I felt closest to death was last october in Toubkal, second highest peak in Africa. We got caught weak and unprepared by stormy weather, strong enough to hit 4 adults on the ground. We made it to peak walking near cliffs. How we survived? By staying together with two other strangers and holding eachother's hands. .

The world is full of wonderful people who will welcome and share with you expecting nothing. We need to get out of the mindset of both fear and competition. We're neither fighting nor racing, we are surviving together. Someone made my notebook, another made my pencil. No matter I paid for both, it's only ethical if I use that pencil and notebook to write things that don't upset them. you're not superior because you got money, power or good education. You have that nice car and house but you didn't make both, people sacrificed from their lives and worked hard to make them for you. Is it fair if you think you're superior than someone made your clothes? Your money doesn't worth anything if other people don't sacrifice time. We survive together as one, and it's only ethical if when we do it fairly. üëãüèº

## medina in marrakech

have you watched morning routine of birds ? they get together every sunrise time and hunt together above beautiful rocks on a sea or ocean coast. I loved watching their life in Point Reyes and Big Sur. Economy is good for the fishes because the sea is rich, even a broken bridge becomes food for them. Earth is magical.


## survival
The second highest mountain in Africa is called Toubkal, and is in Morocco. We went there last month and hiked to the summit in a bad stormy weather. It was my first time to see such a powerful wind that suddenly hits you and you find your body on the ground. As you get close, your foot gets quite close to the cliff sometimes, and all you can do is just wishing it's a lucky day.

We met two Moroccan students on the way because we were the only 4 humans left in the whole mountain, and the nature never jokes when it catches you weak, it can beat you up to the death. We all felt getting close to the death and this made us be friends instantly. We literally walked holding eachothers hands, motivating eachother like we're wrestlers. One of the Moroccan guys were having issues with his health because of smoking, so stopped in the middle. Rest of us made to the peak, and didn't mind to eat the canned food left by someone else. Who cares about hygene when your body needs to fight for survival.

We made it back to the basecamp, and the storm was still going there, our tent was already taken out by the wind, fortunately it didn't fly away. There were more young Moroccan people preparing to make it to the summit next day in the base camp, we started trying to make fire together but it was so hard under the storm. If you go there, you'll see the whole basecamp is surrounded by walls and you have to pay if you wanna put your tent inside. And there was a hotel inside the wall, full of white europeans in vacation. They built the walls surrounding all the dry area, so for people who doesn't want to pay, there was just wet ground left for camping, and not much luck for hiding from the wind. We desperately tried to make campfire, tried to fix our tent but finding a not wet ground with an angle protecting us from wind was so hard, and our tent was not strong enough to resist the wind. So we started hiking back to the nearest town same day with our backpacks weighing about 15kg.

After hours of walking and camping on the way, we made it to the nearest town next morning. I remember looking at the town from distance and loving its colorful houses built so similar and closely to eachother. In Asia, middle east and Africa, houses are built closely to eachother and all houses are about same size. One day after surviving, I remembered that our ancestors settled down for a reason; surviving. There was no other chance. They would not be able to make even a fire otherwise. And they were financially equal because they built these towns in solidarity to survive. We can see how the law of the nature works in clearly in this example; humans can't survive without being a community who live in solidarity.

## apples, birds and beauty
Groceries nowadays have perfect looking apples because the farmers started using medicine to keep the birds away from biting their apples. No matter how much they bite, we don't want them to touch "our" apples. Why ? The nature has such a meaningful balance; birds take small bites, humans come and grab the rest. It's the same taste, except apples with bird bites look different. They don't fit the beauty standard set by popular movies. People want their ikea table to have plasic looking untouched apples. To me though, an apple with some bird bites on it look a lot more beautiful honestly. When we take it from the tree, we see the art of the nature on it. All those random patterns... That's the beauty of the nature.

## time

Time is the energy of the universe. You give it some energy, it gets some stuff done. For example, Give the earth half a year, it can grow a tree. Give two humans 9 months, they can make another human.

Our journey begins with time. The earth turns around the sun for itself and for us, giving every single of us a new day. When we observe then nature, we see their rituals of celebrating a new morning, a new season, similar to humans. We all appreciate and celebrate the time. Because it's given to all of us equally, and it's completely free by its nature.

## joshua tree

I was in Joshua Tree a month ago and thought ‚Äúthese cactus plants don‚Äôt need a lot of water, but they grow and they‚Äôre persistent‚Äù.    Creating a way of living that depends on little amount of ‚Äúwater‚Äù (money, or funding) is actually equal to having a lot of ‚Äúwater‚Äù. In the other words, if we actually liberate the society from needing a lot of ‚Äúwater‚Äù by improving the minimum living standard, it‚Äôll be the same thing with having millions of dollars invested on community projects. Sorry if my english is limiting me. What I wanna say is we need a land that gives us much less water but enough to be free, so we can build our projects‚Ä¶

A part of the society demand an economic system that doesn‚Äôt need a lot of ‚Äúwater‚Äù (money) but it‚Äôs distributed in such a way that is enough for letting a lot of plants (people) grow and be persistent.

## the sunnah paradox
I'm raised as Muslim and spent a lot of time thinking about it during my life. My relationship with Islam has been an adventure, sometimes hated and abandoned it, sometimes loved it. Traveling in Asia and Africa, learning about other cultures which influenced Islamic culture, now I realized that I shouldn't rush to come to conclusions about it. Thinking is joyful when you don't rush for conclusions.

Because it's more complex than we think. Take sunnah for example, one of the core concepts of islam. It says, we are required to follow Muhammad. When you tell this to people, they take it as "repeating". Whatever he did, we need to repeat. He did extra pray on evenings, ok we should also do that, he liked cats, ok we also like cats (true example, notice how street cats are treated in Islamic countries).

But there is one thing Muhammad did; he refused the heritage of his time's society and made a revolution. He didn't repeat anything. So should we also follow him on refusing the heritage completely ? If we little bit do, we could open room for a lot of changes on Islam.

## cats vs dogs
Relationship with a dog is very simple and annoying because the dog never see you as friend. It'll love you the whole time no matter if you're treating it good or bad. Unfortunately, dogs see humans superior than them, and they even let humans control their whole life.

In contrast, cats won't love you unconditionally. It'll be a complicated relationship depending on both sides attitude and mood. They won't let you control their life because they don't see humans superior than them.
