## How to travel with little money?

### General Rules
* Own your time 100%

### Avoiding getting over-charged
Local businesses in touristic areas usually charge tourists and locals differently. Here are some tips for getting local price;
* Learn numbers and how to ask price in local language
* Go out with locals (Hitchhiking and CouchSurfing will help you socialize) to get idea of pricing
* Eat from where local people eat, observe how much they pay
* Try not to ask prices of simple stuff like bread, eggs. Learn the price and pay it like you already know the price.
* If you have to ask the price, then ask it when a local person is paying for the same thing.

### How to hitchhike to islands and overseas?

* Learn how trade is done between where you are and your destination.
* If it's an island, hi 4-5 hours away, hitchhike with commercial trucks getting on boat to that island. This works perfectly in Indonesia, we hitchiked from Java to Flores in 5 days last August.
* If it's an overseas destination try [findmycrew](findacrew.net)

## My Principles

* Don't travel for ego, desire, comfort or money.
* Travel for learning and experiencing a different culture. Open your heart to learning from others. Everyone knows something you don't know.
* Have roadmates that you are together for having fun and exploring around, not for financial goals.
* Leave no trace. 
* Respect and adopt to other cultures.
* Share mutually. Sharing is giving without expecting. Don't take advantage of others. Be ethical when you share and watch out for others if they are happy to share. .
* Patriotic and religious bullshit is not welcomed. Don't argue with locals about their views or choices.
* Everyone is equal. Noone is superior than others.

## Morocco Route

Our route in Morocco has been;

* **Casablanca Airport**: we started hitchhiking to Fez after landing. We didn't spend time in Casablanca.
* **Muhammadiya**: It's has a nice beach and highly recommended to have sardine sandwiches. Look for narrow streets with food vendors.
* **Fez** Historical medina is quite beautiful, we spent 3 days to explore. 
* **Chefchaouen** A town with all houses painted with blue colors. We spent one day two nights here.
* **El Hoceima** We camped in the beaches three nights. Not the best beaches I've been though.
* **Fez** We got back to Fez after El Hoceima because we were on the way to Sahara. 
* **Maadid** A town on the way to Sahara. It's historical but tourists don't stop. There was a big date fruit market here.
* **Merzouga / Eastern Sahara** Definetely recommended here. We camped in the desert two nights without a tour. People usually buy camel tours, we didn't have budget for that.
* **Ouarzazate** It was on our route, so we stopped and stayed with a couchsurfing host. Nothing interesting. 
* **Aït Benhadou** An ancient ksar (a city built defensively against attacks). Must seen.
* **Marrakech** A beautiful ancient Medina, similar to Fez but bigger and has hipster cafes run by western people. We spent 3 days here and definitely worthed. Local food in Medina is so good. Definitely recommended.
* **Toubkal** Second highest peak in Africa. We camped there a day. It's touristy and not welcoming towards people who want to camp with their own tent. 
* **Essaouira** Close to beaches, historical and quite beautiful medina. The chaotic port with all that birds and cats, lovely. We spent 3-4 days here.
* **Imsouane** We got a ride from a Swedish couple going here so dropped by to see it, it's a calm little beautiful town with a beach perfect for surfing. It made me wanna stay there for all my life but our budget was too tight for staying here, so we started hitchhiking to Agadir same night.
* **Agadir** A modern town with nothing interesting. We had a friendly Couchsurfing host with quite similar interests though, ended up staying a week here.
* **Tiznit** It has a nice beach good for surfing outside the city, and a historical medina, and not much interesting stuff. Locals think it's a quite boring town and this is where we settled down for 1.5 months.
* **Legzira** Morocco's signature beaches are here. We met a young fisherman who built his home inside a cave, and stayed with him one night. One of the best experiences in Morocco.
* **Tafrouate** a little town famous for leather products like shoes. it's nearby an area similar to joshau tree. it has some painted rocks, some people like them and they look cool in the photos, but I thought they'd look better without painting.
* **Amtoudi** A nice little town with ancient castle looking thing called "Agadir" on top of a mountain.
* **Dakhla/Western Sahara** It has white desert touching the ocean. We camped there one night and started hitchhiking back to Tiznit. 
* **Tiznit Again** We got back to Tiznit and now we're just hangin out and waiting our flight to Jordan.
* **Marrakech again** We got back to Marrakech again to spend our last 5 days here. The live music in Cafe Clock was pretty good but we missed the wednesday jam session. 
* **Casablanca** We're taking train from Marrakech to the airport in Casablanca. Good bye Morocco!
