# random thoughts

thoughts come and go. here I keep some of them.

## the sunnah paradox
I'm raised as Muslim and spent a lot of time thinking about it during my life. My relationship with Islam has been an adventure, sometimes hated and abandoned it, sometimes loved it. Traveling in Asia and Africa, learning about other cultures which influenced Islamic culture, now I realized that I shouldn't rush to come to conclusions about it. Thinking is joyful when you don't rush for conclusions.

Because it's more complex than we think. Take sunnah for example, one of the core concepts of islam. It says, we are required to follow Muhammad. When you tell this to people, they take it as "repeating". Whatever he did, we need to repeat. He did extra pray on evenings, ok we should also do that, he liked cats, ok we also like cats (true example, notice how street cats are treated in Islamic countries). 

But there is one thing Muhammad did; he refused the heritage of his time's society and made a revolution. He didn't repeat anything. So should we also follow him on refusing the heritage completely ? If we little bit do, we could open room for a lot of changes on Islam.

## apples, birds and beauty
Groceries nowadays have perfect looking apples because the farmers started using medicine to keep the birds away from biting their apples. No matter how much they bite, we don't want them to touch "our" apples. Why ? The nature has such a meaningful balance; birds take small bites, humans come and grab the rest. It's the same taste, except apples with bird bites look different. They don't fit the beauty standard set by popular movies. People want their ikea table to have plasic looking untouched apples. To me though, an apple with some bird bites on it look a lot more beautiful honestly. When we take it from the tree, we see the art of the nature on it. All those random patterns... That's the beauty of the nature.

## time

Time is the energy of the universe. You give it some energy, it gets some stuff done. For example, Give the earth half a year, it can grow a tree. Give two humans 9 months, they can make another human.

Our journey begins with time. The earth turns around the sun for itself and for us, giving every single of us a new day. When we observe then nature, we see their rituals of celebrating a new morning, a new season, similar to humans. We all appreciate and celebrate the time. Because it's given to all of us equally, and it's completely free by its nature.

## joshua tree

I was in Joshua Tree a month ago and thought “these cactus plants don’t need a lot of water, but they grow and they’re persistent”.    Creating a way of living that depends on little amount of “water” (money, or funding) is actually equal to having a lot of “water”. In the other words, if we actually liberate the society from needing a lot of “water” by improving the minimum living standard, it’ll be the same thing with having millions of dollars invested on community projects. Sorry if my english is limiting me. What I wanna say is we need a land that gives us much less water but enough to be free, so we can build our projects…

A part of the society demand an economic system that doesn’t need a lot of “water” (money) but it’s distributed in such a way that is enough for letting a lot of plants (people) grow and be persistent.
