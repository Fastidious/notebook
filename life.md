## The True Meaning of Integrity

> What does it take to be someone who leads with integrity? Consciousness and choice. I believe that there are at least 6 things that great leaders choose to do to be on a journey towards greater integrity:

* Understands the true definition of integrity (hopefully after this post, you will be able to check this box).
* Intentionally reflects on what to say, how to behave, how to make decisions in a way that is reflective of his/her values and beliefs.
* Is the same authentic person regardless of the situation. You can meet this leader with their family, friends, church, or at a boardroom, and you will see a consistency in behavior, actions, and words. You will recognize this person no matter what environment he/she is in.
* Recognizes the impact that he/she has on others. This leader is conscious of how his/her behavior and words impacts those around them intentionally and often times, unintentionally. So when this leader behaves in a way that is out of integrity, he/she stops, acknowledges, apologizes, and corrects course. This requires humility, authenticity, and ‘others-centeredness’ as you need to ‘see’ how others are responding to you.
* Actively focuses on the development of character and wholeness. This leader spends time intentionally on this area through various areas, such as reading, getting coached, listening to the counsel of others, going to leadership development courses, and reflecting on how to develop character.
* Enrolls others to be on the same journey. This leader aims to walk in integrity and as others see that, they are drawn to this. They can have confidence in this leader with the belief that this leader will do what he/she says and believes. They are able to inspire others to be on the same journey of lifelong pursuit of ‘wholeness’ and ultimately, INTEGRITY.

## The Three Things I Look For in a Person

[Source](https://www.fs.blog/2013/05/warren-buffett-the-three-things-i-look-for-in-a-person/)


> “You’re looking for three things, generally, in a person,” says Buffett. “Intelligence, energy, and integrity. And if they don’t have the last one, don’t even bother with the first two. I tell them, ‘Everyone here has the intelligence and energy—you wouldn’t be here otherwise. But the integrity is up to you. You weren’t born with it, you can’t learn it in school.”

> “You decide to be dishonest, stingy, uncharitable, egotistical, all the things people don’t like in other people,” argues Warren. “They are all choices. Some people think there’s a limited little pot of admiration to go around, and anything the other guy takes out of the pot, there’s less left for you. But it’s just the opposite.”

## Self-advices

* Be free, own yourself.
* Chase;
  * True Love
  * Knowledge
  * Inspiration
  * Freedom
  * New experiences
  * Build Good habits
    * Avoid being addicted to social media and the phony rewards like follower, rt, like counts..
    * Learn how to manage your time
    * If you can do something in less than a minute, do it now without delaying
* Have goals, remember your them along the way. (p.s reach small goals first before the bigger ones)

* Not an authentic invitation. (They didn't take the time to understand what you do.)

## Friendship

![](https://cldup.com/45jCK3YVWS.jpg)

Seneca [writes in his letters](https://www.brainpickings.org/2017/05/19/seneca-friendship/):

> One who seeks friendship for favourable occasions, strips it of all its nobility.

> If you consider any man a friend whom you do not trust as you trust yourself, you are mightily mistaken and you do not sufficiently understand what true friendship means… When friendship is settled, you must trust; before friendship is formed, you must pass judgment. Those persons indeed put last first and confound their duties, who … judge a man after they have made him their friend, instead of making him their friend after they have judged him. Ponder for a long time whether you shall admit a given person to your friendship; but when you have decided to admit him, welcome him with all your heart and soul. Speak as boldly with him as with yourself… Regard him as loyal and you will make him loyal.

## 8 Qualities of Cultured People

According to [Anton Chekhov](https://www.brainpickings.org/2013/01/29/anton-chekhov-8-qualities-of-cultured-people/)

* They respect human personality, and therefore they are always kind, gentle, polite, and ready to give in to others.
* They have sympathy not for beggars and cats alone. Their heart aches for what the eye does not see….
* They respect the property of others, and therefor pay their debts.
* They are sincere, and dread lying like fire. They don’t lie even in small things.
* They do not disparage themselves to rouse compassion.
* They have no shallow vanity. They do not care for such false diamonds as knowing celebrities.
* If they have a talent they respect it. They sacrifice to it rest, women, wine, vanity…
* They develop the aesthetic feeling in themselves. They cannot go to sleep in their clothes, see cracks full of bugs on the walls, breathe bad air, walk on a floor that has been spat upon, cook their meals over an oil stove.

## Qualities we need in our every day lifes

* Intelligence
* Compassion
* Generous
* Respectful

## Wisdom

[Attributes of wise people;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox8XlcUppbo)

* **Realism:** Knowing that something is difficult to accomplish doesn't rob the wise' ambitions. It makes them more steadfast, calmer and less prone to panic.
* **Gratitude:** They can take pleasure from single sunny day, or some flowers growing by a brick wall. Because they've seen how hard things can be to get, they know how to draw the full value from peaceful and sweet whenever and wherever these arise.
* **Folly:** The wise are unsurprised by the coexistence of deep immaturity and sexual perversity alongside quite adult qualities like intelligence and morality. They know that we are barely evolved apes, aware that at least half of life is irrational. They try wherever possible to budget for madness and a slow to panic when it reliably raised its head.
* **Humour:** The wise take the business of laughing at themselves seriously.
* **Politeness:** The wise are realistic about social relations. In particular, changing people's lifes, and have an affect on their lives. Therefore they're extremely reticent about telling people too frankly about what they think. They'll sit with someone of an opposite political persuation and not try to convert them. They'll be aware of how differently things can look through the eyes of others. They'll search for what people have in common than what separates them.
* **Self-acceptance:** The wise have made their peace with yawning gap between how they ideally want to be, and what they're actually like. They've come to terms with their idiocy floors ugliness limitations and drawbacks. They are not ashamed of themselves, and yet they understand their craziness.
* **Forgiveness:** The wise are realistic about other people. They recognize the extraordinary pressures everyone is under to pursue their own ambitions, defend their interests, seek their pleasures. The wise know that most hurt is not intentional, it's a by product of the constant collision of blind competing egos in a world of scarce resources. They're slow to anger and judge. The wise feel less persecuted by the agression and meanness of others because they have a sense of where it comes from; a place of hurt.
* **Resilience:** The wise have a solid sense of what they can survive. They know how much can go wrong, and things will still be just about liveble. Unwise draws the bounderies of their contentment so that it encompasses and depends upon fame money personal relationships popularity health.
* **Calm:** They nurture such a strong commitment to the idea of being calm. A quiet evening feels like an achievement, a day without anxiety is something to be celebrated. The wise are not afraid of boring time.

## 5 ways to build lasting self-esteem

Noted from [Ted Ideas](http://ideas.ted.com/5-ways-to-build-lasting-self-esteem)

Improving self-esteem requires a bit of work, as it involves developing and maintaining healthier emotional habits but doing so, and especially doing so correctly, will provide a great emotional and psychological return on your investment.

#### Use positive affirmations correctly

Ironically, positive affirmations do work for one subset of people — those whose self-esteem is already high. For affirmations to work when your self-esteem is lagging, tweak them to make them more believable. For example, change “I’m going to be a great success!” to “I’m going to persevere until I succeed!”

#### Identify your competencies and develop them

Self-esteem is built by demonstrating real ability and achievement in areas of our lives that matter to us.

#### Learn to accept compliments

The best way to avoid the reflexive reactions of batting away compliments is to prepare simple set responses and train yourself to use them automatically whenever you get good feedback (e.g., “Thank you” or “How kind of you to say”).

#### Eliminate self-criticism and introduce self-compassion

Whenever your self-critical inner monologue kicks in, ask yourself what you would say to a dear friend if they were in your situation and direct those comments to yourself.

#### Affirm your real worth

Make a list of qualities you have that are meaningful in the specific context.

## Why do we see dreams?

Noted from a [TED Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W85Dwxx218)

* Our brains clean up (forget) unncessary details when we see dreams, so next day we can think clearly.
* Napping improves memory.
* We practice some protective skills like running away from enemy in dreams because our protective insticts needs to stay sharp in case we need them
* We dream to heal. As stress is not active when we sleep, we have better perspective on our traumatic experiences during dreaming.
* As dreams are not limited with reality, we can solve problems better in our dreams.

## Confidence Tips

Noted from a [TED video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_NYrWqUR40)

* Picture your success when you begin a difficult task
* Believe in your ability to improve. Have growth mindset.
* Practice failure. Those who fail are better equipped to face challenges.
* Be kind to yourself when you make mistakes.


## Better Conversation Advices

Noted from the [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/celeste_headlee_10_ways_to_have_a_better_conversation) I watched and liked a lot.

#### Don’t Multitask
Be present, be in that moment. Don’t be half in, half out.

#### Don’t pontificate
If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity to response, write a blog. Everyone you will ever meet, knows something you don’t.

#### Use Open Ended Questions
Start your [question]() with Who, Where and When. If you ask complicated questions like “Were you terrified?” you’ll get a simple answer like “yes”. Let them describe. Ask “how was it like?”

#### Go With The Flow
Thoughts will come into your mind, you need to let them go. Don’t let thoughts make you stop listening.

#### If you don’t know, say that you don’t know.
Talk should not be cheated.

#### Don’t equate your experience with theirs
If they talk about a trouble at work, don’t tell them how much you hate your job. It’s never the same. All experiences are individual. More importantly, it’s not about you, it’s about them. Conversations are not promotional opportunity.

#### Try not to repeat yourself
It’s condescending. Don’t repurchase same thing over and over.

#### Stay out of the weeds
People don’t care about details like date, location. They care about you. Forget the details.

#### Listen
Most of us don’t listen with the intent to understand, we listen with the intent to reply.

#### Be Brief
A good conversation is like miniskirt, short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.
