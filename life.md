## Better Conversation Advices

Noted from the [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/celeste_headlee_10_ways_to_have_a_better_conversation) I watched and liked a lot.

#### Don’t Multitask
Be present, be in that moment. Don’t be half in, half out.

#### Don’t pontificate
If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity to response, write a blog. Everyone you will ever meet, knows something you don’t.

#### Use Open Ended Questions
Start your [question]() with Who, Where and When. If you ask complicated questions like “Were you terrified?” you’ll get a simple answer like “yes”. Let them describe. Ask “how was it like?”

#### Go With The Flow
Thoughts will come into your mind, you need to let them go. Don’t let thoughts make you stop listening.

#### If you don’t know, say that you don’t know.
Talk should not be cheated.

#### Don’t equate your experience with theirs
If they talk about a trouble at work, don’t tell them how much you hate your job. It’s never the same. All experiences are individual. More importantly, it’s not about you, it’s about them. Conversations are not promotional opportunity.

#### Try not to repeat yourself
It’s condescending. Don’t repurchase same thing over and over.

#### Stay out of the weeds
People don’t care about details like date, location. They care about you. Forget the details.

#### Listen
Most of us don’t listen with the intent to understand, we listen with the intent to reply.

#### Be Brief
A good conversation is like miniskirt, short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.
