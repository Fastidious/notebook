[Attributes of wise people;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ox8XlcUppbo)

* **Realism:** Knowing that something is difficult to accomplish doesn't rob the wise' ambitions. It makes them more steadfast, calmer and less prone to panic.
* **Gratitude:** They can take pleasure from single sunny day, or some flowers growing by a brick wall. Because they've seen how hard things can be to get, they know how to draw the full value from peaceful and sweet whenever and wherever these arise.
* **Folly:** The wise are unsurprised by the coexistence of deep immaturity and sexual perversity alongside quite adult qualities like intelligence and morality. They know that we are barely evolved apes, aware that at least half of life is irrational. They try wherever possible to budget for madness and a slow to panic when it reliably raised its head.
* **Humour:** The wise take the business of laughing at themselves seriously.
* **Politeness:** The wise are realistic about social relations. In particular, changing people's lifes, and have an affect on their lives. Therefore they're extremely reticent about telling people too frankly about what they think. They'll sit with someone of an opposite political persuation and not try to convert them. They'll be aware of how differently things can look through the eyes of others. They'll search for what people have in common than what separates them.
* **Self-acceptance:** The wise have made their peace with yawning gap between how they ideally want to be, and what they're actually like. They've come to terms with their idiocy floors ugliness limitations and drawbacks. They are not ashamed of themselves, and yet they understand their craziness.
* **Forgiveness:** The wise are realistic about other people. They recognize the extraordinary pressures everyone is under to pursue their own ambitions, defend their interests, seek their pleasures. The wise know that most hurt is not intentional, it's a by product of the constant collision of blind competing egos in a world of scarce resources. They're slow to anger and judge. The wise feel less persecuted by the agression and meanness of others because they have a sense of where it comes from; a place of hurt.
* **Resilience:** The wise have a solid sense of what they can survive. They know how much can go wrong, and things will still be just about liveble. Unwise draws the bounderies of their contentment so that it encompasses and depends upon fame money personal relationships popularity health.
* **Calm:** They nurture such a strong commitment to the idea of being calm. A quiet evening feels like an achievement, a day without anxiety is something to be celebrated. The wise are not afraid of boring time.

## 5 ways to build lasting self-esteem

Noted from [Ted Ideas](http://ideas.ted.com/5-ways-to-build-lasting-self-esteem)

Improving self-esteem requires a bit of work, as it involves developing and maintaining healthier emotional habits but doing so, and especially doing so correctly, will provide a great emotional and psychological return on your investment.

#### Use positive affirmations correctly

Ironically, positive affirmations do work for one subset of people — those whose self-esteem is already high. For affirmations to work when your self-esteem is lagging, tweak them to make them more believable. For example, change “I’m going to be a great success!” to “I’m going to persevere until I succeed!”

#### Identify your competencies and develop them

Self-esteem is built by demonstrating real ability and achievement in areas of our lives that matter to us.

#### Learn to accept compliments

The best way to avoid the reflexive reactions of batting away compliments is to prepare simple set responses and train yourself to use them automatically whenever you get good feedback (e.g., “Thank you” or “How kind of you to say”). 

#### Eliminate self-criticism and introduce self-compassion 

Whenever your self-critical inner monologue kicks in, ask yourself what you would say to a dear friend if they were in your situation and direct those comments to yourself.

#### Affirm your real worth

Make a list of qualities you have that are meaningful in the specific context. 

## Why do we see dreams?

Noted from a [TED Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2W85Dwxx218)

* Our brains clean up (forget) unncessary details when we see dreams, so next day we can think clearly.
* Napping improves memory.
* We practice some protective skills like running away from enemy in dreams because our protective insticts needs to stay sharp in case we need them
* We dream to heal. As stress is not active when we sleep, we have better perspective on our traumatic experiences during dreaming.
* As dreams are not limited with reality, we can solve problems better in our dreams.

## Better Conversation Advices

Noted from the [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/celeste_headlee_10_ways_to_have_a_better_conversation) I watched and liked a lot.

#### Don’t Multitask
Be present, be in that moment. Don’t be half in, half out.

#### Don’t pontificate
If you want to state your opinion without any opportunity to response, write a blog. Everyone you will ever meet, knows something you don’t.

#### Use Open Ended Questions
Start your [question]() with Who, Where and When. If you ask complicated questions like “Were you terrified?” you’ll get a simple answer like “yes”. Let them describe. Ask “how was it like?”

#### Go With The Flow
Thoughts will come into your mind, you need to let them go. Don’t let thoughts make you stop listening.

#### If you don’t know, say that you don’t know.
Talk should not be cheated.

#### Don’t equate your experience with theirs
If they talk about a trouble at work, don’t tell them how much you hate your job. It’s never the same. All experiences are individual. More importantly, it’s not about you, it’s about them. Conversations are not promotional opportunity.

#### Try not to repeat yourself
It’s condescending. Don’t repurchase same thing over and over.

#### Stay out of the weeds
People don’t care about details like date, location. They care about you. Forget the details.

#### Listen
Most of us don’t listen with the intent to understand, we listen with the intent to reply.

#### Be Brief
A good conversation is like miniskirt, short enough to retain interest, but long enough to cover the subject.
